# Iris-Hydra

Iris-Hydra is an Ory Hydra fork, with modifications required so that it can be
used as the "Iris" OAuth2.0 Authorization Server component.

Original ory-hydra [README](HYDRA_README.md)

## Branching

Active development takes place on the `iris-hydra-X.Y.Z` branch, where `X.Y.Z`
is the version of Hydra that Iris-Hydra is based on. All non-Hydra(Iris) commits
should appear AFTER the last Hydra commit in this branch.

**Important:** When switching to a new Hydra version, the branch should be
rebased on top of the new Hydra version.

**Note:** The `master` branch is read-only and tracks Hydra's master branch.

## Versioning

Iris-hydra uses the same versioning as Hydra, with the addition of a suffix to
indicate the Iris-Hydra specific part. Suffix is in the format `-iris-A.B.C`,
where `A.B.C` is the major, minor and patch version.

Example: `2.3.0-iris-0.1.0`

## Code formatting and code conventions

We follow the same formatting and code conventions used in Ory Hydra. The rules
are enforced for all pull requests by relevant GitHub actions.
